'PA 1 Coin Problem
'Name: Carl Berger
'Help recieved: Winston helped me with some math logic in order to get the ounces to roll over into pounds after hitting 16 ounces.
'Self-Assessment: Not sure because i used totalPounds as a static; i think the point was to somehow get the total pounds from the static Ounces by just using division.
'sort of like how the ounces change into pounds after hitting 16.
